# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Time delivery enures that the work does not exceed the planned budget allocations for the design process. Peer working and coordination during the building and edesign phase are very helpful in project management. To ensure that deadlines are met, it is important for the managers set plans that are sustainable , timebound and attainable

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control ensures that the expenditure does not run outside the budget thus pointing out the success of the project without overruns. Some of the effective cost control strategies include and are not limited to defining the goal of the project, setting timelines and creating a budget.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
The waterfall methodology outlines that completing one task after the other in a linear structure is very important. The main advantage of this approach has a low risk level and a high level of documentation. However, unlike the former, the agile breaks projects in projects and emphasises collaborative working. This one is purposely important in time saving and division of labour.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
In projects that need need continous changes and updates like mobile apps and websites, agile methodology is very helpful. But waterfall that may need behave like agile is applied in projects like road construction and sky scrapers.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Process orientated approach which focuses on ensuring there are no defects during the developement process. It ensures there are bugs during the developement process. The product orieneted approach intends to avoid any defects on the end product.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
A Work Breakdown Structure allots a project into very small units that can be delt with by many people within an organisation. Defining the project scope projects the desired man power and any other non-manual assistance required to complete the task

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps organise elements within a project depending on their order of priority setting desired timelines that are very helpful. Gantt charts assists in organising items in order of importance.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
It aims at solving the data figures health workers are facing in my community. Loosing patient information can affect the treatment process and sometimes resulting into sudden death.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
It appreciates the nature of the needs of the target audience thereby not interfering the needs and the objective.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
The purpose of the software is to solve the outstanding problem of loosing patient information for local communities

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Secure strorage of patient data, beautiful design of the software and a user-friendly interface of the software.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The software may be provided to three medical facilities that admit 50-100 patients per day. It is likely to grow to 200 patients in take in the next four month.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It helps establish the needs of the audience. And also the group of people that requires the software.
